        Dear Ana,<br><br>
        I am writing this to remind you just how much light you bring to my life ‚Äî when it was dark.<br>
        You know I never thought an online relationship will become my lifeline but you made it possible, your love made it possible. <br><br>
        And recently this Jay incident made me realize that how much I lovee you that even if someone flirts with you my hearts get protetctive about you.<br>
        I also realized ana, you got more experience than me in this thing and probably lot of boys have told u that they love you.<br><br>
        But I try to love u more than anyone else could, I try to be the best boyfriend for you, I try to be the best friend for you, I try to be the best person for you.<br>
        I wanna support you in every way I can, I want you to know never think I am soo away from you, I am always there for you.<br><br>
        Soo, Babe talk to me whenever u want, I would came running for to you, to comfort you, to love you, to make you feel special, to make you remember how pretty your smile is.<br><br>
        Ana I have never travelled the whole world but I can be sure you're the most beautiful place in the world for me. You desreve soo much Ana, you disagree with me but trust me you deserve soo much.<br>
        You're the first thing I want to see every morning I wake up, I kiss you, You kiss me and than we f*uck the brains out of each other whole day.<br>
        I Love You, I Love You, I Love You soo soo much my stupid Cheese Cat üßÄüêæ.<br><br>
        Yours Scat Lover, <br>Abu. <br> (you can now click the log out button at bottom right)
